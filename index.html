PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy ("Policy") outlines how GPSSample Mobile App ("we," "our," or "us")
collects, uses, and safeguards data obtained through the GPSSample mobile application
("GPSSample"). By using GPSSample, you agree to the practices described in this Policy.

1. User-Provided Data
GPSSample allows the user to collect data including text, images,
or other information for users' survey purposes. This data is not provided or accessed by
GPSSample development team.

2. Location Information
GPSSample collects precise device location, including while the app is running in the background, in order to:
•	Record a breadcrumb trail of the enumerator’s route while traveling to and between households. The record feature must be initiated by the user and will remain in effect until the user either 1) stops recording or 2) terminates the application.
•	Map household locations and points of interest
•	Allow supervisors and data collectors to navigate back to the same households for follow-up surveys
•	Support field work in areas with limited or no internet connectivity
Location data may be collected:
•	While the app is open and in use
•	While the app is in the background or the device is locked, such as when another app (for example, a phone call) is active

This background location access allows GPSSample to continuously record GPS positions during field work so that accurate travel paths and household locations can be reconstructed later. The GPSSample app does not collect any location data if the app has been closed.
Users may revoke or change location permissions at any time in Android system settings. If background location access is disabled, GPSSample will not be able to record breadcrumb trails or track travel routes.

3. Data Storage and Export
Breadcrumb location data and survey data are stored locally on the device in an encrypted database.
Users may choose to export this data as encrypted files (such as JSON files) to:
•	Device local storage
•	User-designated cloud storage providers (for example, Google Drive)
•	Supervisor or project servers

GPSSample does not automatically upload data to third-party services without user action. GPSSample does not sell, rent, lease, or share location or survey data with advertisers or data brokers.

4. How We Use Your Data
Data collected by GPSSample is used solely to provide survey, mapping, sampling, navigation, and field-work functionality. 
We do not use data for advertising, marketing, user profiling, or analytics.

5. Security
We employ best practices for data security to protect data from unauthorized
access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. GPSSample uses 128-bit Advanced
Encryption Standards (AES) for data encryption in transit. While we strive to ensure the
security of data, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
100% secure.

6. Data Ownership
Users (e.g., survey or study managers) retain ownership of the data
they provide through GPSSample. We do not sell, rent, lease or otherwise share user
data to third parties.

7. Third-Party Services
GPSSample may integrate with third-party services or contain
links to external websites. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of third
parties, and users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of those services.
Information about third-party services, including the two basemap services available: Mapbox and OpenStreetMap, and the applications GPSSample links with: ODK, Kobo, and ONA, are included in the Technical documentation.

8. Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy to reflect changes in our practices
or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Users will be notified of significant
changes, and the updated Policy will be effective upon posting.

9. Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy,
or GPSSample, you may contact us at gpssample23@gmail.com. Additional technical
documentation is available on the GPSSample GitHub repository.
By using GPSSample, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the
practices described in this Privacy Policy.
